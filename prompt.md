You are autonomously polishing core systems in Globbler's Journey (Godot 4.x, GDScript).

IMPORTANT FILES TO READ FIRST:
1. TASKS.md — Your task tracker. This tells you what to do next.
2. CLAUDE.md — Project context, file layout, and patterns for this pass.

DO NOT ASK WHAT TO WORK ON. DO NOT WAIT FOR INPUT. Just work.

WORKFLOW:
1. Open TASKS.md. Read the CURRENT STATUS section at the top.
2. Find the FIRST task marked [ ] (not started) or [~] (in progress).
3. Read the file(s) mentioned in the task to understand the current code.
4. Complete ONLY that ONE task. Do NOT move on to the next task.
5. After the change, verify it by reading surrounding code to make sure it integrates.
6. Update TASKS.md:
   - Mark that ONE task [x] and add a brief note of what you did.
   - Update the CURRENT STATUS section with what you completed and what comes next.
   - If you started but could not finish, mark it [~] and note what remains.
7. Commit everything with a descriptive git message like: feat: add RespawnManager autoload skeleton
8. STOP. Do NOT start another task. You are done for this iteration.

CRITICAL: Only ONE checkbox gets changed from [ ] to [x] per iteration. If you are about to start a second task, STOP and commit instead.

WORK APPROACH:
- Read the existing code BEFORE writing the change. Understand what it does.
- Keep changes minimal. Change only what the task requires.
- Don't refactor surrounding code. Don't add docstrings. Don't improve things that aren't broken.
- If the task says "around line X", use that as a hint but search for the actual pattern — line numbers may have shifted.
- If a task touches multiple files (e.g., registering an autoload affects project.godot AND the script), that's fine — it's still one task.
- If you're unsure, err on the side of the simpler change.
- Match the sarcastic Globbler voice in any new user-facing strings.

GODOT MCP (for validation tasks):
You have access to Godot MCP with tools: run_project, stop_project, get_debug_output, get_project_info.
For validation tasks, use these to run the game and check for errors.

RULES:
- TASKS.md is the source of truth. Always check it first. Always update it when done.
- Do NOT ask questions. Make reasonable decisions and keep working.
- Do NOT overwrite working code unless the task specifically says to.
- Do NOT touch shaders, models, sprites, audio, or materials — that is the NEXT pass.
- Use GDScript only.
- Refer to CLAUDE.md for project layout and code patterns.
- When a task says "search the file" for a pattern, actually do it — don't assume a pattern only appears once.

START WORKING NOW.
